My 86 year old mother is the owner of an ecommerce retail website, so she could probably better explain it to me. Way back in 1996, when most college freshman and sophmores were but a twinkle in their parents' eyes, she had a little flea market booth business where she sold sunglasses & reading glasses. It wasn't exactly an immobile booth stuck in one particular flea market stall. Rather, she moved from street festival to street festival, packing her old van to the roof with pipes and boxes and tarps and merchandise. Many of the fairs in NYC attracted droves of tourist from all over the world, so she had a little catalog printed up, and people would buy from her through the mail all year round. She was almost 70 when the dot com boom occurred. I can remember vividly when she told me over the phone, in her thick NY accent, "We got a webmastuh and he's going to build us somethin' on the world wide web". 

Within a a few years, she made enough money to retire from the flea markets and concentrate on her web only business. 

Now a website in 1996 looked very different than it does now. Though she doesn't code beyond simple html (she knows how to rock a bullet point <li></li>),  she competely understands the concept behind it. She understands that 5 years ago, everyone navigaged ecommerce sites using a side menu, while now the design leans towards a top menu because it helps open up the space beneath. After all, she spearheaded a complete website overhaul just a few months ago, using Nordstrom and Macy's as her north star guide. 

What she sees in a page layout may perhaps be more in tune than most people. She is a painter. Throughout various careers and life events, art was her foundation. She filled blank canvasses with flowers, colors, shapes, oceans, paint and space. 

Sometimes it can test my patience to explain technological details to her,  and I remind myself that her demographic had the biggest learning curve of all. They truly have learned more than any of us. Septegenerians and octagenerains started out with typewriters, and not even electric ones. Likewise, they appreciate this new world the most...it makes sense to them.  They had roomfuls of filing cabinets at work. They had to consult an elaborate file system at the library if they had a question none of their friends could answer, or gasp...pore through volumes of their encyclopedias. That little box that connects us to the universe changed their lives more than anyone. 

Sure, I can explain to her what parts of a page are called. Columns, headers, footers, and such. But I think she's taught me a whole lot more about the impact of fonts, colors, composition.
