I wanted to be a coder since I was a senior in high school back in 1985. Before windows or apple was a household name, we had these black screens with blinking lights in the computer lab, and learned Basic, Fortran and Pascal. I remember creating loops, variables and calculations and getting the rudimentary program to print on this strange computer paper with little holes lining each side so the printer could roll it out with prongs.

That class was pivotal to my confidence in the year before college. At the time, I wasn't the best in math, yet for some reason the congnitive skills behind coding math problems seemed to be an angle I grasped more easily. Nobody had personal computers back then, so that lab was a sort of secret club. 

Most of all, I loved the sense of control. How after intensely firing up some neurons, I could sit back and watch that baby roll out the instructions on a tangilbe piece of paper. 

I wanted to be a computer programmer way back then. However, I also wanted to be a lot of other things. A rock star, a doctor, a writer. Since there were very few coders around suburban NYC, I followed a path more familiar. Actually, my first career was slow to adopt computer technology and I felt like the world was leaving me behind. I went from a student of one of the first public school computer labs to the last person I knew to purchase a PC. Somewhere in that time, I secretly vowed that my life would not be hinged on a single career and I would have to morph to accomodate my other dreams.
